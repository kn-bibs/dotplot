  # PyQt testing fails when there is no display available. Normally,
  # in plain Qt one would use "-platform offscreen" on testing tools
  # although those are not available nor the option to change platform
  # is exposed in PyQt API. Successful workaround is to create a virtual
  # framebuffer to be used as a dummy display for testing purposes.
